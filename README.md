# GastroPolypSegmentation
Colorectal Cancer is a massive burden on our society today with it being the fourth most common cancer in the world. With a 35 percent mortality rate and causing 8.6 percent of all cancer deaths, it is one of the most dangerous cancers. The American Cancer Society also finds that colorectal cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths among men under 50 and the second-leading cause of cancer death for women in the same age group.  It is estimated that 4.1 percent of all American men and women will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer, making it a top priority to find means for early detection and polyp removal.

Gastrointestinal Polyps are masses of cells or tumors that form on the inside linings of your stomach or colon. These polyps are the cause of colorectal cancer, and are extremely common with 15-40% of American adults developing them within their lifetimes. These polyps then have a 6-10% chance of developing into malignant tumors, which results in colorectal cancer.

The purpose of this project is to improve upon current methods of gastrointestinal polyp detection. Studies have shown that 38.69% of patients have at least one polyp missed during manual colonoscopy, along with a general polyp miss rate of 17.24%. Furthermore, virtual colonoscopies(or the other method of detecting polyps) only identified about 65% of the patients who had polyps detected by manual colonoscopy. Therefore, current methodologies are far too inaccurate and unreliable and risk the safety of the patient. My project aims to address this, using various machine learning models to detect gastrointestinal polyps in a timely and accurate manner, which will greatly aid the chances of colorectal cancer prevention.

After training, a peak accuracy of 96.8% was reached with the resnet-34 model.
